					"My name is Michelle Mohr and I am lucky enough to teach fourth grade at St. Joseph School. 
					This will be my seventeenth year teaching and I am so excited to meet my new students and 
					explore fourth grade with them!  I was born and raised in Juneau, Alaska.  I have a 
					Bachelor's degree in psychology and religion from University of Puget Sound and my Master's 
					degree in Teaching from City University.   In 1996 I began my teaching career with the Clark
					County School District in Las Vegas as a first grade teacher.  In 2001 I moved back to WA and
					taught three years in the Highline School District in second grade and as a reading specialist.
					I worked for the Lake Washington School District several years and for the past four years I have
					been at St. Joseph School.  My son graduated from St. Joseph School last year.   I enjoy reading,
					walking my dogs-Cooper and Lily , and spending time with family and friends.  Please look forward
					to this school year and all the joy and inspiration it will bring!
